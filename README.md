### payload encryption
all requests require a `sec_hash` that can be generated as described below

payload is the POST data  
`sec_hash` and `credentials` are not included in the sec_hash generation

the payload key values are combined into a string like GET query params 
i.e  

```
key1=val1&key2=val2
```
the payload keys *must* be lowercased when creating the string  

the `sec_hash` is a keyed hash value of the payload string using the HMAC method (sha256) 

base64 decoded *API key* is the shared secret key used for generating the HMAC variant of the message digest
